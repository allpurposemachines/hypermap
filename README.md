# HyperMap

## About

HyperMap is a new RESTful API standard.
HyperMap services are easier to build and use than traditional REST services, while being significantly more powerful and dynamic.

Mech is a universal client that can talk to any HyperMap service. It removes the need to build client wrappers/SDKs for every service.
It is currently shipped as an NPM package with JavaScript bindings.

## Status

Both the HyperMap standard and Mech are in prototype stage. Expect significant changes.
