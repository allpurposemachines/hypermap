# Why HyperMap?

Web pages aren’t raw text files, they’re rich documents built from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They can use Web APIs like fetch, Server-Sent Events, and WebSockets to build pages that load asynchronously and stream in new data. JavaScript and Web Assembly let you build anything from simple interactivity to full client-side apps working on local data.

Shouldn’t your APIs be just as powerful?

HyperMap brings the last 20 years of progress around the Web to APIs. It's designed to be really easy to adopt for existing APIs as it’s encoded in JSON and idiomatic JSON is already valid HyperMap.
