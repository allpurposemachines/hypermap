# HyperMap

## About

HyperMap is a new RESTful API standard. HyperMap services are easier to build
and integrate than traditional REST services, while being significantly more
powerful and dynamic. HyperMap is built around 2 core ideas:

1. It's self-descriptive (also known as hypermedia) — this lets you cut down on
   human readable documenation and elimiate machine readable specs by moving the
   metadata about using the API into the responses themselves.

2. It supports code on demand — this means that you can send JavaScript or
   WebAssembly to the client to execute there, letting you do things like
   reacting to asynchronous data using `fetch`, SSEs, or WebSockets, or even
   moving whole computations to the client to improve performance or privacy.
   This is obviously an incredibly successful capability of the Web that hasn't
   been applied to REST APIs until now, despite being part of the
   [original list of REST constraints for over twenty years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST#Code_on_demand_(optional))!

Mech is a universal client that can talk to any HyperMap service. It removes the
need to build client wrappers/SDKs for every service. It's pretty minimal at the
moment but if it doesn't do something you need that's fine — it supports code on
demand! Just have your API send some JavaScript to add the capabilities you need
for your service.

It currently has bindings for JavaScript running in a browser environment, with
more environments and languages to come.

## Examples

There are some common headaches with APIs that HyperMap solves:

1. Eliminate Webhooks — Webhooks are great for notifying a client that a long
   running process has completed but assumes you have a publicly reachable URL
   to POST back to. This isn't the case if you're developing native apps,
   developing locally, or running on CI.

   Instead, with HyperMap you can just create an EventSource and listen to SSEs:

   ```json
   {
     "#": {
       "scripts": ["/eventHandler.js"]
     },
     "ticketId": "2277",
     "status": "pending"
   }
   ```

   ```js
   const evtSource = new EventSource("/tickets/2277/events");

   evtSource.onmessage = (event) => {
     hypermap.set("status", event.data);
   };
   ```

   Apps looking to react to this change can just use an event handler through
   Mech:
   ```js
   const ticketTab = Mech.open("https://example.com/tickets/2277/");

   ticketTab.on("changed", () => {
     console.log(`New status: ${ticketTab.at("status")}`);
   });
   ```

2. Unify REST and streaming endpoints — something that's increasingly common is
   to ship two APIs: a regular REST one for structured data and a WebSocket one
   for streaming data. With HyperMap you can have the best of both worlds:

   ```json
   {
     "#": {
       "scripts": ["/streamHandler.js"]
     },
     "aapl": 180.67,
     "meta": 321.91,
     "googl": 138.80
   }
   ```

   ```js
   const stockSocket = new WebSocket("wss://example.com/stocks/");

   stockSocket.onmessage = (event) => {
     const msg = JSON.parse(event.data);
     hypermap.set(msg.ticker, msg.price);
   };
   ```

3. Client-side pre-processing — if you need to process data that's private or
   sensitive you might need to hard-code some logic in your wrapper/SDK to scrub
   that information before sending to your service. With HyperMap you can ship
   the logic to the client alongside the API reponse, ensuring it works in any
   supported language and is always up to date. See the privacy-preserving text
   sentiment analysis demo in the `example_server`.

## Status

Both the HyperMap standard and Mech are in prototype stage. Expect significant
changes!

## Getting started

Take a look at the [documentation](https://docs.allpurposemachines.com/), the
server in `/example_server`, and `/mech/tests/test.js`.

To run the example locally install [Deno](https://deno.com/runtime) and then
run:

```sh
$ deno run --allow-net --allow-read --watch=. example_server/app.ts
```
