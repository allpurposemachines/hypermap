# HyperMap Shim

This script is designed to be run in a browser to parse and execute HyperMaps.
HyperMaps should be passed to the script by rendering them in a `pre` tag,
as in the example index.html. This was chosen to match the default behaviour
of Chrome and Safari when rendering a JSON content type.
