# Introduction

HyperMap and Mech form a new stack for RESTful APIs. They let you run JavaScript or
WebAssembly on the client, which can massively simplify the documentation and integration for modern, sophisticated APIs. Using HyperMap and Mech you can do things like:

- Eliminate Webhooks
- Unify JSON and WebSocket APIs
- Move privacy-preserving data analytics to the client

And much more.

## Getting Started

[APM Explorer is a Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=all-purpose-machines.apm-explorer) for interacting with HyperMap services and generating stub Mech integration code. While not mandatory, it's a great way to start exploring HyperMap.

Then, read [the guide to converting an existing API to HyperMap](/converting-an-api/) for an introduction to the main HyperMap and Mech features.

Finally, take a look at [the example server](https://github.com/allpurposemachines/hypermap/tree/main/example_server) for a working HyperMap service which showcases a number of HyperMap features.
